# Sales-Analysis-Using-Python-Seaborn

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer demographics, spending patterns, and revenue contributions using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. By leveraging **Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**, we uncover key insights from sales data to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Pandas**: Data preprocessing and aggregation
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization and trend analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development and execution environment
- **Excel (Optional)**: Data export and further analysis

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of **14 columns and 11,251 records**, including:
- **Customer Demographics**: Gender, Age Group, Marital Status, and State
- **Transaction Details**: Purchase Amount, Product Category
- **Geographical Data**: State-wise distribution of customers and revenue

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps
### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary columns with missing values
- Handled null values in critical fields
- Converted numerical values into appropriate data types

### 2️⃣ Data Exploration
- Identified trends in **customer spending behavior**
- Analyzed **gender-wise** and **age-group-wise** purchase patterns
- Evaluated **state-wise customer distribution and revenue generation**
- Visualized **top product categories contributing to sales**

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization
- **Count Plots**: Distribution of customers by gender, age group, and marital status
- **Bar Charts**: State-wise revenue and top purchasing demographics
- **Pie Charts**: Contribution of different categories to total sales

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Which gender and age group contributes the most revenue?**
- **Which state has the highest number of customers?**
- **What are the top spending categories among customers?**
- **How does marital status impact purchase decisions?**

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
### Prerequisites

   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run the notebook file **Customer_Insights_EDA.ipynb** step by step.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Implement **Machine Learning models** to predict customer behavior
- Automate **data processing and visualization dashboards**
- Integrate **real-time data streaming** for dynamic insights

## 📜 Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into customer behavior using **EDA techniques**. Businesses can use these findings to optimize their marketing strategies, target the right audience, and enhance customer engagement.
